/** \file
Simple message passing library

Message: What is sent from Messenger to Subject, a templated type.
Messenger<T>: Sends out messages of type T.
Receiver<T>: Receives messages of type T.

If the receiver expects multiple messengers, it should inherit from multiple Receiver<T>
types and implement receive( const T& ); for each type. This eliminates the need
for casting present in the previous, non-templated version of the library.

If you want to send multiple types of messages from a single object, you should
compose Messengers into your class rather than inheriting. Then provide your own
interface for adding/removing receivers to the different messengers.
Another option is to define a custom message type that is flexible enough for your
needs and inherit Messenger<AwesomeTypeMessage>.

The Messenger and Receiver automatically unregister themselves in their destructors,
so no messages will be sent to objects that are out of scope. To do this, the Messenger
and Receiver maintain a circular reference to each other.

When a Messenger or Receiver is copied, the network of Receiver/Messenger relationships
in the copied object is rebuilt in the assigned object.

Clang doesn't like the multiple append()/deliver()/remove() function declarations
that result from multiply-inheriting from Messenger<T>. I wouldn't mind if Clang
recognized the separate signatures of multiply inherited append()/remove()/deliver()
methods, but using composition is a good option and may help your code be more readable.

Typical use, with Message template:
typedef MessageT<class Whatevs> WhatevsMessage;
class Messenger : public Messenger<WhatevsMessage>
{ ...
  deliver( Message( *this, "change" ) );
}
class Receiver : public Receiver<WhatevsMessage>
{ ...
  void receive( const Message &msg )
  {
  	auto info = msg.getSubject().getWhatevaInformation();
  }
}

enum Event{ CHANGE, VANISH };
typedef MessageT<WhatevsMessage> Message;
Messenger<Message> messenger;
Receiver<Message> receiver;
shared_ptr<Receiver<Message>> r_ptr;
...
messenger.appendReceiver( &receiver );
messenger.appendReceiver( r_ptr.get() );
...
// assuming this is an instance of Whatevs
messenger.deliver( WhatevsMessage( *this, CHANGE ) );
Receiver<Message>::receive( const Message &msg )
{
	if( msg.getEvent() == CHANGE ){
  	... do something, maybe with msg.getSubject();
  }
}
...
messenger.removeReceiver( &receiver );
