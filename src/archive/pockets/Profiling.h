/**
 OpenGLTimer:

 Simplifies the task of asynchronously querying OpenGL for timing information.
 Call begin() and end() before and after the blocks you want to measure.
 Call getMilliseconds() to know how much time elapsed between begin() and end().
 Note that getMilliseconds() does not block, and will return the last time queried
 from OpenGL when new query results are not ready.

 The timer's begin() and end() functions won't restart timing the section of
 interest until you have retrieved the latest timing value using getMilliseconds()
 or getMillisecondsBlocking().

 Basic usage:
 timer.setup(); // initialize OpenGL QueryObject id
 ...
 timer.begin(); // start timing section
 // issue some OpenGL commands
 timer.end(); // end timing section
 double ms = timer.getMilliseconds();

 To get some information on what exactly this is abstracting, see:
 http://www.opengl.org/wiki/Query_Object
