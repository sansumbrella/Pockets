/**
 LayeredShapeRenderSystem:
 Multi-pass, layer-sorted rendering system.

 TODO:
 New RenderSystem type (combined 2d and 3d)
 Determine layer-order by using OpenGL depth buffer for non-sprited content; should enable more seamless 2d + 3d combinations.
 Provide convenience method for 1:1 scaling when pushing content back in Z.
 Use render pass like tag predicate for iteration.
 Skip the initial render pass generation.
 For sprites, we can't draw to depth buffer (because of masking in zero-alpha regions)

 The LayeredShapeRenderSystem is designed to quickly display active entities. It can
 handle all of your sprites, particles, and generative 2d meshes.

 For rendering large background and foreground elements, use a different system.

 Each pass is a batch of LayeredShapeRenderData components combined into a single
 triangle strip. The render passes are:
 1. Normal Pass
 - Geometry is drawn in layer order with premultiplied alpha blending
 If a texture is assigned, it will be bound before rendering begins.
 The same texture will remain bound through all render passes.
 For "untextured" geometry, we leave a white pixel in the top-left corner
 of our sprite sheets and set all vertex tex coords to their default 0,0.
